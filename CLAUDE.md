# RehtiArvio — rules for agents and humans

Free benchmark + listing analysis for Finnish apartment investors. Live at
https://rehtiarvio.vercel.app. This file is the project constitution: the
constraints below were each earned the hard way in one intensive build day
(2026-07-05). Do not relax them without the owner's explicit decision.

## Non-negotiable rules

### Legal / data lanes

1. **Never scrape Oikotie (or any listing portal) systematically.** Their ToS
   forbids "säännöllinen, järjestelmällinen tai jatkuva tietojen kerääminen".
   The ONLY permitted fetch is a **user-directed single-URL fetch** at analysis
   time, https-only, against the host allowlist in
   `src/lib/server/listing-parse.ts` (`allowedListingUrl`). Do not add crawl
   loops, caching of listing pages, or bulk fetch — anywhere, including the geo
   repo's extraction fleet (Oikotie is excluded there by source policy too).
2. **StatFin attribution is a license condition, not decoration.** Price data
   is Tilastokeskus table 13mt, CC BY 4.0. Rent data is Tilastokeskus table
   asvu 13eb, CC BY 4.0. "Lähde: Tilastokeskus" must remain visible in the
   footer and on the map views; the OG share card carries the 13mt attribution
   line and must continue to.
3. **No personal data storage beyond what's declared.** `query_log` stores
   query facts (postal code, rooms, price), never listing URLs or addresses.
   `leads` stores an email the user typed in themselves. `reports.facts` may
   additionally carry structured figures deterministically parsed from
   documents the buyer pasted at order time (vastikkeet, lainaosuus,
   korjausvuodet — see `doc-parse.ts`); the pasted document text itself is
   never stored, and the parser must never extract names or free prose.
   Consent-gated visitor analytics and the pseudonymous product-usage event
   stream are a separate, opt-in data lane — see rule 13. They must never be
   merged into `query_log`, which stays exactly as described above: no
   visitor correlation, not personal data, no consent required.

### Product honesty

4. **A verdict never ships as a naked percentage.** Always delta + confidence
   tier (korkea/kohtalainen/matala/ei saatavilla) + interpretation flags.
   Validated biases the flags must keep covering: new-build premium (can be
   ±40%, inverts in areas like Jätkäsaari), unit-size effects (small yksiöt
   above area mean, large units below), intra-postal heterogeneity, and
   StatFin-suppressed cells (validated against live listings, 2026-06).
5. **No LLM calls in the web request path.** Listing extraction is
   deterministic (`listing-parse.ts`). LLM/agent work (tilinpäätös scorecards,
   search-based enrichment) runs offline on the homeserver worker and lands in
   Supabase; the site only reads results.

### Engineering

6. **No Next.js.** Owner decision (CVE track record). Stack is SvelteKit 2 +
   `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`, runtime pinned `nodejs22.x`, region `fra1`.
7. **Secrets live only in Vercel env** (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
   `MML_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`). Never commit them; `.env` is gitignored;
   history is verified clean — keep it that way.
8. **Supabase writes are best-effort.** `supalog.ts` must never throw or delay
   a response; the site works fully without Supabase (bundled seed).
9. **Parser changes need fixture proof.** Real-world listing text is hostile
   (doubled label/value lines, portal footers, kuntotutkimus decoys). Run new
   parser code against a pasted-listing fixture AND a URL-fetch torture fixture
   before shipping. Known traps already fixed once — don't regress:
   grouped-number parsing must not merge repeated numbers ("54 54" ≠ 5454),
   scalar fields take only their first line, page tails are cut at
   `CUTOFF_MARKERS`, and kuntotutkimus/selvitys/suunnittelu lines are never
   "completed renovations".

### Design

10. **Clean and simple; intentional, not templated.** Design tokens live in
    `src/lib/styles/tokens.css`: editorial paper/ink palette (bg `#fafaf7`,
    brand = publication ink `#0a0a0a`), light theme only; signal colors are
    reserved for verdict direction (warn `#b3261e` = over market, good
    `#1d6f3a` = under market). Square corners, no gradient heroes, no emoji
    section markers. Layout convention (documented next to the container
    tokens): containers prose 38rem / app 62rem (the `<main>` default) /
    wide 76rem (map + chrome); canonical breakpoints 480 / 720 / 900 px plus
    `@media (pointer: coarse)` for ≥44px tap targets. Map ramp/breaks live in
    `src/lib/PriceMap.svelte` (MiniMap dots mirror it) — the ramp is
    lightness-monotonic and CVD-validated; don't eyeball replacements.
    **Logo mark:** the canonical monogram (a geometric ink-tile "R" over a
    baseline rule — a nod to asking-price-vs-baseline) lives in one source,
    `src/lib/brand/mark.ts`; Header/Footer inline it, the `/og` share card
    embeds it, and `static/favicon.svg` + `static/logo.svg` mirror it
    byte-for-byte. It stays neutral ink — signal colors are never spent on
    chrome. Change the artwork in one place and re-sync the two static files.
11. **UI language is Finnish; code and docs are English.**
12. **Touch parity on map surfaces.** Hover-only affordances are forbidden:
    /kartta's coarse-pointer tap-to-pin panel must keep exposing €/m² +
    transaction count, and the landing map links to /kartta as its touch
    affordance.

### Privacy / consent

13. **Visitor tracking is consent-gated, not automatic — and this rule
    required the owner's explicit sign-off** (2026-07-22, see
    `docs/MINIMAXGDPR_PLAN.md`). Three consent categories, stored in the
    `ra_consent` cookie and mirrored in `consent_log`: necessary (always on —
    `ra_access`, `ra_consent` itself), analytics (one disclosed purpose
    covering both traffic behavior and product/business-usage events — see
    `/tietosuoja`), marketing (reserved for a future ad-retargeting pixel;
    consent plumbing exists, no pixel is wired yet). PostHog (EU Cloud,
    `eu.posthog.com`) — neither the client script (`posthog-js`, dynamically
    imported in `posthog-client.ts`) nor server-side capture (`posthog-node`,
    `src/lib/server/analytics.ts`) — may run before the `ra_consent` cookie
    records `analytics:true`; any new event call site must gate on
    `analyticsDistinctId(cookies)` (server) or the consent context (client),
    the same way `logQuery`/`addLead` call sites already exist. `consent_log`
    records every accept/reject/customize/withdraw action, written
    best-effort via `supalog.ts` (rule 8's pattern) — it is the GDPR
    Art. 7(1) proof-of-consent record; don't let it silently stop writing.
    Any further expansion of what's collected under an existing consent
    category, or any new category, needs the same explicit owner sign-off as
    this rule did — not just an added event call.

## Dev environment gotchas (Windows host)

- Local `vite build` with adapter-vercel fails on Windows (symlink EPERM).
  Build happens on Vercel's Linux builders — don't fight it locally.
- `vercel deploy` CLI uploads hang intermittently from this machine; prefer
  git-integration auto-deploys (see ROADMAP — pending repo-visibility
  decision) or retry in foreground.
- Svelte attribute `pattern="[0-9]{5}"` is parsed as an expression — write
  `pattern={'[0-9]{5}'}`.
- Testing form actions with curl: send `Origin: <site-origin>` (CSRF) and
  `Accept: text/html` (otherwise you get devalue JSON).
- Restart the dev server after changing `$lib/server` modules if results look
  stale; kill by port (netstat → taskkill), not by name.
- **SvelteKit's `+server.*` route matcher accepts `.js`/`.ts` only.** `@vercel/og`
  wants a React-style JSX tree; the OG route at `src/routes/arvio/og/+server.ts`
  builds the element tree with a plain `h()` helper in `template.ts` (no JSX,
  no `react` dep — `react` ships inside `@vercel/og` and we don't import it
  at build time). Renaming the route to `.tsx` will break the matcher and
  the route will 404 silently; don't.

## Data regeneration

- **Benchmark cells (13mt, sale prices):** monthly Vercel cron calls
  `/api/refresh` (guarded by `CRON_SECRET`); StatFin publishes quarterly. With
  Supabase configured the cells upsert into `benchmarks`; without it the
  refresh returns cells in the response — paste into
  `src/lib/server/benchmarks.seed.json`.
- **Rent cells (asvu 13eb, rents):** same cron pulls the postal-code rents
  table in the same call. 13eb lives in the **StatFin_Passiivi** (archive)
  database, not the live asvu; it is still refreshed quarterly (latest update
  2026-01-15) and the URL is stable, but treat it as an archived source. If
  the table id or URL breaks, fall back to the live regional table `15fa`
  (Whole country / Greater Helsinki / Uusimaa / … / Rovaniemi) for a
  town-level-only mode. **Suppression rule** from StatFin: cells with < 20
  observations or a high rental-housing-company share are returned as null —
  never substitute a different number; the rents engine's postal→town tier
  chain handles fall-back. The cron synthesizes town-level cells
  (transaction-weighted average of populated postal cells in the same town)
  and writes both postal and town rows to the `rents` table with a
  `postal_or_town` discriminator. Without Supabase, the response payload is
  the same shape as the existing `rents.seed.json`; paste it in.
- **`rents.seed.json`** ships 2,048 cells (1,740 postal + 308 synthesized town
  fall-backs), bootstrapped from 2025Q1–Q4. Regenerate with:
  `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/build-rents-seed.mts`
  It writes both `rents.seed.json` and `postal-areas.ts` (the postal→town
  lookup the engine's tier chain uses). Per project convention, regeneration
  scripts now live in `scripts/` rather than the geo repo scratch.
- `centroids.json` + `static/map-data.geojson` come from Paavo postal-code
  polygons (WFS) joined to the seed; regeneration scripts live in the geo repo
  scratch (`C:/tmp/geo-bench/`) — promote them into `scripts/` here if touched
  again.
- **Derived market metrics** (2026-07-18): `price-change.seed.json` (previous
  4-quarter 13mt window for the mix-controlled 12-mo change) and
  `paavo.seed.json` (median income `hr_mtu` + dwellings `ra_asunn`) power the
  /kartta map modes, tables and CSV. Rerun after each benchmark refresh /
  annual Paavo vintage:
  `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/build-price-change.mts`
  `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/build-paavo-stats.mts`
  `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/enrich-map-data.mts` (writes the
  metrics into `static/map-data.geojson`; run it last). Metric definitions
  live in `src/lib/server/areametrics.ts` and must stay in sync with the
  /miksi copy. Null means below-threshold or suppressed — never substitute.

## Related repos

- The Stage-1 extraction worker, its prompts, data-source validation docs,
  and business planning live in a **separate private repository**. This repo
  must stay deployable and understandable on its own: the only contract
  between the two is the Supabase schema (`reports` in, `scorecards` out).

## The plan

Current state, pending blockers, and the staged business plan are in
`docs/ROADMAP.md`. Read it before starting new work.
